    <h1>Interview Preparations Questions</h1>
    <pre>
    1. Difference between flex row and column.
        - The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
            flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
    
    2. Explain inline, internal and external stylesheet.
        - INLINE = Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with element. 
                   This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using the style attribute. 
        - INTERNAL =  This can be used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely.
                      The CSS rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file. 
        - EXTERNAL = External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style property with the help of tag attributes
                     (For example class, id, heading, … etc).
                     CSS property written in a separate file with .css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using link tag.
    
    3. Justify-content allows you to do what ?
        - The justify-content property specifies how flex-items are distributed along the main axis of their parent flex-container.
          5 values: flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-between.
    
    4. Difference between absolute and relative positioning.
        - position: relative = places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas 
          position: absolute = places an element relative to its parent’s position and changing the layout around it.
        
    5. What is grid-template-columns used for?
        - it specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout.
          The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.
    
    6. What is the z-index in CSS?
        - it specifies the stack order (Overlap) of an element.
          An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

          Note: z-index only works on positioned elements 
                (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and 
                flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).

          z-index: auto|number|initial|inherit;
        
    7. What is the difference between padding and margin?
        - Two sub-properties of CSS.
          Margin = Margin is said to be the outer space of an element, 
          i.e., the margin is the space outside of the element's border.

          Note:-  both -ve and +ve values. Size of element remains the same.

          Padding = Padding is said to be the inner space of an element, i.e., the padding is the space inside of the element's border.

          Note:- only +ve values. Size of element increases.

    8. What is box sizing?
        - The box-sizing property in CSS defines how the user should calculate the total width and height of an element 
          i.e padding and borders, are to be included or not.
          Syntax:- box-sizing: content-box|border-box;

    9. What is animation delay?
        - The animation-delay property sets how much time passes before an animation starts. 
          It’s expressed in seconds and milliseconds.

        Syntax:- animation-delay: [time] | initial | inherit;
             INITIAL returns the property to the default value for the element.
             INHERIT turns the property into a child of the parent element.
    
    10. Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?
        - The grid-column property specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout
          grid-column: grid-column-start / grid-column-end;
    
    11. Which property you will use to merge cells horizontally in grid?
        - grid-row: grid-row-start / grid-row-end;

    12. Explain CSS box model.
        - The CSS Box Model is a term used for the container that wraps the following element properties within it.
          Margin
          Border
          Padding
          Content
          Height and Width

    13. What is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?
        - display:none 
            means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom). 
            There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags.

          visibility:hidden 
            means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. 
            The tag is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.
