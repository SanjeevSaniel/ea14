    <h3 class="headings">What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or
            in other media.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
            <strong><del>Css is not necessary</del><mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark></strong> It can control the
            layout of multiple web pages al at once.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li><em><u>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></em></li>
        <br />
    </ol>
    <h3 class="headings">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="css-usages">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS
            files. However,
            <mark><strong>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</strong></mark>
            because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it
            yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a
        style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one
        unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to
        link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. <br /><br />
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
        elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
        of styles can be applied to the element. <br /><br />
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.
