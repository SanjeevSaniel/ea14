        >What is Virtual DOM ?</a
      >
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding ‚Äúvirtual DOM
        object.‚Äù A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, like
        a lightweight copy.
      </li>
      <li>
        A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but
        it lacks the real thing‚Äôs power to directly change what‚Äôs on the screen.
        Manipulating the DOM is slow.
      </li>
      <li>
        Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster, because nothing gets drawn
        onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint,
        as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. <a href="" target="_blank">What is SPA ?</a></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The name single-page application generally refers to the application
        consisting of one page that is constantly updated by JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        Requests to the server are now quicker since they contain just the data
        needed to update the view.
      </li>
      <li>
        SPAs are full applications, running in the browser yet still connected
        to a server to update any application data.
      </li>
    </ol>

        >What is difference between class and functional component ?</a
      >
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Class components contain a state and use a render() function to return
        JSX markup. When defined, the class has to be an extension of the
        React.Component class:
        <pre>
            import React from 'react';
            class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
              this.state = {
                property1: "A string",
                property2: 1,
                property3: true
              }
          
              render() {
                return (
                  &lt;div&gt;
                    ...
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                )
              };
            };
          </pre
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Function components are stateless and only use the return statement. No
        import statement necessary:
        <pre>
            const FunctionComponent = (props) => {
              return (
                &lt;div&gt;
                  ...
                &lt;/div&gt;
              )
            }
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/state" target="_blank"
        >What do you mean by state and its use in react ?</a
      >
    </h2>
    <p>
      The state object is where we store data in a component that is expected to
      change over time. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
      State is created and maintained by the component itself. Class and
      functional components handle state differently. Functional components use
      hooks to manage state.
      <pre>
        class Car extends React.Component {
          constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {
              brand: 'Chevrolet',
              model: 'Malibu',
              color: 'white',
              year: 1998,
            };
          }
          render() {
            return (
              &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;My First Car&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                  It is a {this.state.color}
                  {this.state.brand}
                  {this.state.model}
                  made in {this.state.year}. üöô
                &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;
            );
          }
        }
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>5. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/jsx" target="_blank">What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js ?</a></h2>
    <p>
        JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript that combines the JavaScript and HTML-like syntax to provide highly functional, reusable markup. It‚Äôs used to create DOM elements which are then rendered in the React DOM. <br>
        While not required in React, JSX provides a neat visual reqresentation of the application‚Äôs UI.

    <h2>6. <a href="https://blog.ezekielekunola.com/understanding-the-package.json-file" target="_blank">What is package.json ?</a></h2>
    <p>
        A package.json is a JSON file that exists at the root of a Javascript/Node project. It holds metadata relevant to the project and it is used for managing the project‚Äôs dependencies, scripts, version and a whole lot more.
