What is Node Js ?

- Node is a runtime environment for executing JS code.
- Essentially, Node is a C++ program that embeds Chrome’s v8 engine, the fastest JS engine in the world.
- We use Node to build fast and scalable networking applications. It’s a perfect choice for building RESTful services.
- Node applications are single-threaded. That means a single thread is used to serve all clients.
