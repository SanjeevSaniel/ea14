    <h2>1. What is node.js ?</h2>
    <p>
      <li>Node is a runtime environment for executing JS code.</li>
      <li>
        Essentially, Node is a C++ program that embeds Chrome’s v8 engine, the
        fastest JS engine in the world
      </li>
      <li>
        We use Node to build fast and scalable networking applications. It’s a
        perfect choice for building RESTful services
      </li>
      <li>
        Node applications are single-threaded. That means a single thread is
        used to serve all clients
      </li>
    </p>

    <h2>2. What is NPM ?</h2>
    <p>
      <li>
        Every Node application has a package.json file that includes metadata
        about the application. This includes the name of the application, its
        version, dependencies, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use NPM to download and install 3rd-party packages from NPM registry
      </li>
    </p>

    <h2>3. What are the modules in Node.js ?</h2>
    <p>
      In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates
      with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.
      Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
      The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their
      re-usability as well as the ability to break down a complex piece of code
      into manageable chunks.
    </p>

    <h2>4. What is the purpose of the module.exports?</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of module.exports is to achieve modular programming.
      Modular programming refers to separating the functionality of a program
      into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains
      everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired
      functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Difference between default export and named export</h2>
    <p>
      Named and Default exports are not React-centric ideas. They are ES6
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      With named export, one can have multiple named export per file. And then
      when you want to import a named component, you use the same name it was
      exported with. Names must be imported inside curly brackets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Default exports are created by including a default tag in the export. One
      can have only one default export per file. When we import we have to
      specify a name
    </p>

    <h2>6. How do you import any module in Node.js</h2>
    <p>const module = require("module_name");</p>
    <p>
      Example: <br />
      const http = require("http")
    </p>
